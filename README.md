## 🧭 The Real-Life Story

Every family has someone who needs regular tests and prescriptions. Managing all those reports and follow-ups becomes messy.  
When the doctor says, *“Pichlay reports laao,”* we start scrolling through WhatsApp or digging into folders 😩.

**HealthMate** solves this by providing a single, secure space to:
- Upload all your **medical reports** (PDF or image)
- Get **AI-powered summaries** (no OCR needed!)
- View your entire **health timeline**
- Add manual vitals like **BP, Sugar, Weight**
- Read everything in **simple bilingual format** (English + Roman Urdu)

## 💡 The Big Idea

> “Yeh sirf ek project nahi — ek real-life problem ka digital solution hai.”

HealthMate uses **Gemini AI** to automatically read and explain uploaded medical reports.  
It simplifies complex lab data, highlights important points, and gives you insights you can actually understand.
